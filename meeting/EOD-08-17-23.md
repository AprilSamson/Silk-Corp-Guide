# End of the day report

Today I scanned the SILK Corp guide and find some area to improve. It is almost completed. We just need some polishing and approval on our Pull requests. I recreate my PR on issue103 which is the Experience 2:
* https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/202/commits/403163b70851ef34e8d0eee11d2a788f0465d5fc

I also hoped in a call to conduct TPM with workmates and we tackle about the task that we are going to conduct.
I hopped in a call with the Phoenix team and they discuss my future task starting tomorrow.
