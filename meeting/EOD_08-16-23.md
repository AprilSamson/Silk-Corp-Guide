I hoped in a call with my team mates and discuss some work issues regarding the PR's we've made and commented on how can we improve our responses.
Today I made a contribution on github by  creating a PRs on SILKCorp guide which are:
* https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/199/commits/f9c145b89a2bc9996bce7c89d5bcec149217241b
* https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/200/commits/923a1b2d8f1fbfb2957ec8ae9150e573b796a3f9

I also check the availability of KVAC appointment there still none available.
