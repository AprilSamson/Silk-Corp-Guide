# End of the day Report

Today I had a TPM meeting with the team and we discussed what are our task for today and also discussed the new policy:
# Starting Monday August 21, there will be no time tracked for anything you do in the organization if you do not comment on an approved issue on Github and talk with Catherine to judge your SMART Comment to track your STAR through our ORBITAL system on the Focus Pass. 
# You have the next 2 days to learn.
# If you do not do this everyday, then you will be downgraded or terminated.  We take our project management very seriously here & use this to track performance, commitment, and our overall progress as an organization.
I created a pull request and do with pasting the comment link to Focus Pass.

I also hopped in a call with phoenix team and also checked the KVAC online appointment and there still none available slots yet

That's all for today. Have a great weekend everyone.
