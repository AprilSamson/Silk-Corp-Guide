End of the day report 
August 30,2023

Today, As a social media influencer for SILK Corp, I uploaded reel in my Instagram account and used the Hashtag #SILKlife. It shows how I enjoyed the beach and get tanned. Also, I put #SILKLife on my previous posts that is on the beach.
Also, I hoped in a call with my workmate and I shadowed her and learned on how to make a Pull request for images in the SILK Corp guide at the github. I also searched images from Envato elements that will be needed for the guide.
I also had a TPM meeting with the team around 6:00 pm PKT and we discussed our task for the day.
And for the highlight, I created a pull request on github which will contribute to the SILK Corp guide if approved. Here's the links:

This a productive day for me and hoping for more for tomorrow.
