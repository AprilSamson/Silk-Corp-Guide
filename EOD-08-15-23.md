# End of the day report
August 15, 2023

Today I attended a TPM meeting with the team and we discussed our Task/or goal for the day.
I wondered around on github and checked my notifications to work on
I created a PR on issue#77 which is the :
* https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/196/commits/1908c2691001ecd0b8658176b8cde95e16de60f7
After creating a PR I checked the whole guide to scan if there's something to improve.
My workmate reviewed my PR and I'll continue working on that:
* https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/196#pullrequestreview-1578635680
* https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/192#pullrequestreview-1578642986
 I will work on these by tomorrow and will make sure that I can provide the request changes they wanted. That's all! Have a good day
